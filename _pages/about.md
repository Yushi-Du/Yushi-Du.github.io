I'm an undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest lies in the intersection between computer vision and robotics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hao Dong]([https://www.XXX.com/](https://zsdonghao.github.io/)) who leads the [PKU-Agibot Lab](https://zsdonghao.github.io/#lab) at Peking University, China.

[**Leveraging SE(3) Equivariance for Learning 3D Geometric Shape Assembly**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06810)
Ruihai Wu, Chenrui Tie, Yushi Du, Yan Shen, Hao Dong
We study geometric shape assembly by leveraging SE(3) Equivariance, which disentangles poses and shapes of fractured parts.
