I'm an undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest lies in the intersection between computer vision and robotics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hao Dong]([https://www.XXX.com/](https://zsdonghao.github.io/)) who leads the [PKU-Agibot Lab](https://zsdonghao.github.io/#lab).
